These are applications we wrote along with this project. *java-kafka-tests* are very bare bones kafka-connectors (one producer and one consumer) while *android-noise-demo* takes microphone amplitude every second (well, kind of) and sends it to tcp://localhost:4444. (In practice, you'd port-forward this port to a computer running a tcp-listener connected to kafka or directly to influx, more information in the respective folder.)
